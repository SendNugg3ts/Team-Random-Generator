# Team-Random-Generator
When me and my friends want to play some football we like to randomize the teams, so when we play, we always play with different teams, to make this easier i made a python script where it asks for the names of 10 players and generates 2 teams with those players.
2.0 version just has the option to play with any even number of players instead of only 10 from the first version.
